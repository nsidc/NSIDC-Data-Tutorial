    "\n",
    "Given Lidar data (latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) taken from a Pre-IceBridge mission in 1993 and data collected from ICESat-2 in 2018, how may we meaningfully compare these two data sets collected 25-years apart? There are a number of factors to consider in such a comparison, including changes in coordinate reference frames and tectonic plate movement across the time series. Given the accuracy and precision of the data, combined with the long time series now available, we investigate their effects. As an example of the rough magnitude of these effects, the Australian plate is moving at a rate of around 7 cm / year, and recently collected satellite and airborne imagery illustrate how this has resulted in a noticeable visible shift from imagery taken in the mid 1990s--over this time the continent has moved nearly 1.8 m. All other areas of the world exhibit similar, if smaller, effects. In this notebook we will enumerate the factors that may bear upon these types of data comparisons, quantify the magnitude of their effects, and illustrate two methods to transform the data sets into a form in which these effects may be mitigated."

    "## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the risk of oversimplifying a complicated subject, we try to provide a baseline set of terms and concepts that will be important for the rest of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coordinate system: A coordinate system will have a dimension; latitude/longitude coordinates are a two-dimensional system, for example. It will also have a convention for the order in which the coordinates are listed, the names of each dimension, and the unit of measurement (a scale) for each dimension. A coordinate system by itself is abstract. We need to \"anchor\" the coordinate system to a body we wish to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Datum: This defines both the origin point and the direction vectors of the axes of a coordinate system with respect to a particular body, in our case the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Coordinate Reference System consists of the choice of coordinate system and a datum which \"attaches\" and orients the coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this notebook, we will consider two types of coordinate reference systems (CRS):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic - The CRS is global and Earth-centered and Earth-fixed. Consequently coordinates of a geographic feature may change over time as tectonic plates move.\n",
    "* Static - The CRS is regional and fixed to a tectonic plate. Coordinates of a geographic feature are stable / fixed as the plate itself moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nomenclature may be confusing and other terms are used in various sources. To clarify the terms we're using in this notebook: in a dynamic CRS, the CRS itself is relatively fixed, but the coordinates are dynamic over time. Likewise, in a static CRS, the CRS itself is actually floating along with the underlying plate, and it is the coordinates that are static over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) realizations are examples of dynamic frames. The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) maintains the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). The ITRS is a formal description of the coordinate reference system, along with the mathematical and experimental procedures used to create the actual concrete reference frame. The concrete reference frame is called a realization. These realizations are issued every few years, and are created as both the Earth changes and as the procedures and data get better and more precise. Examples include ITRF88, ITRF93, ITRF2000, etc. We can think of a specific ITRF as being anchored at the Earth's center of mass (to within a centimeter!), the z-axis as oriented along the Earth's pole (a simplification), the x-axis as roughly pointing to the Greenwich meridian, and the y-axis orthogonal to the other two, forming a right-handed coordinate system. The IERS gathers data on pole precession and nutation, various geophysical effects on the Earth due to ocean and astronomical tides, and the length of day. Periodically the IERS will issue a new ITRF, as well as parameters for transforming to and from older ITRF realizations. This makes it convenient to compare locations at any point on the Earth, but only for the same time, or epoch. Comparing coordinates in a dynamic frame from different epochs presents problems since the geographic features are being moved by plate tectonics, resulting in different coordinates for the same feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast with global dynamic frames like the ITRFs, we can have regional CRSs for an entire continent (e.g. Australia), or even specific countries. These offer convenience for locating features in that region; the coordinates for any object in Ireland, for example, may be easily compared across time, but those coordinates are not immediately comparable the coordinates for the feature in a different reference frame, static or dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the term epoch is used to identify the reference date at which a given reference frame was realized, and also when the coordinates for a particular observation (e.g., lat, lon, elevation) were obtained. For example, GPS coordinates are currently relative to reference frame ITRF 2014 which has a realization epoch of 2010.0. GPS coordinates obtained right now would have an epoch of 2019.x. These epochs will become important as we apply transforms below."
