# IceFlow Point Cloud Data Access

## Summary 

This tutorial introduces the various available airborne and satellite altimetry data spanning missions from 1993 to the present and a python library to access these data sets. 
The here presented IceFlow python library simplifies accessing and combining data from this long-term record, specifically it deals with the problems of different file formats and coordinate reference systems that both changed multiple times over the years. 

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Learn the basics about the data sets (pre-IceBridge, IceBridge, ICESat/GLAS and ICE-Sat-2) served by the IceFlow library. 

2. Learn to access these data sets using the IceFlow user interface widget.

3. Learn to access these data sets using the IceFlow API.

4. Learn to read and analyze the data using IceFlow.
